# Oganesson

Oganesson is a periodic table of elements inspired game based on the famous 2048 game.

Instead of numbers, we have elements of the periodic table represented by their symbols. When combined, they form higher periodic table elements.

My main objective was to make learning fun instead of boring. The aim here is to learn chemical reactions via playing 2048.

## To Do:

- [ ] Introduce level concepts (Level 1-1, Level 1-2, Level 1-3, Level 2-1, Level 2-2, Level 2-3, Level 3-1, Level 3-2 and Level 3-3)
- [ ] Level 1 Smaller elements combine to form higher elements
- [ ] Level 2 Introduction of radicals and combination of elements and radicals to form compounds e.g (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
- [ ] Level 3 Chemical reactions between compounds e.g (HCl + NaOH -> Nacl + H<sub>2</sub>0)
- [X] Elements up to Potassium have been introduced
- [ ] Elements after Potassium to be introduced
- [ ] Concepts of Inert Gases can be introduced and they will not do anything when combined with other elements showing their inertness to reactions
- [ ] Further suggestions for improvement


# Play the Game

# Update
I added another clone of Oganesson - Oganesson - Size 16. It can support grid sizes up to 16x16 just to make the game so that it is available on all Periodic 2048 sites. The game has been modified for endless gameplay too!

# Note
This is a 2048 Chemistry variant, in which two adjacent tiles with the same element can merge to form a tile of the next element. For example, two Selenium (Se) tiles can merge to form a Bromine (Br) tile.

## The 4 new elements renamed 2 years ago are: 
* **Nihonium** and symbol **Nh**, for the element 113,
* **Moscovium** and symbol **Mc**, for the element 115,
* **Tennessine** and symbol **Ts**, for the element 117, and
* **Oganesson** and symbol **Og**, for the element 118.

That screen shot is fake, by the way. I never reached Oganesson :smile:

Man, the highest record in Threes is 832K. I never reached 6144 anyway.

Plus 144 is a Fibonacci number. :smile:
